TO DO: Synergy upgrades both within a single act and outside of it.
Randomized log popups based on current progression and popularity.
Popups on game start & load.
Distinct shiny variation based on result.
Settings menu to opt in or out of extraneous characters.
DWN (Doctor Worm Number) for Mega Man 14 Robot Masters, poke Corbin about designation for 12 & 13’s.
Robots through Auto before we can call this thing playable.
Implement research system, probably themed around Dad and his lab, 1 point every 20 minutes or so? Various threads to pull. One unlocks non-mainline content, which itself will be divided into several sub-projects, another will unlock synergy upgrades, which does the same. Some may cost more than one point.
3 types of synergy upgrades, Forward, Backward, and Hidden. Hidden synergy upgrades are already present, but researching them will reveal their secondary effects. Oiled Skates buffing Roll as well as Top Man, for example. We’ll want one for at least Roll and Proto Man for each game, methinks. Forward synergy upgrades will buff a robot master as well as one from a later game, backwards will do the reverse. We may try and have synergy upgrades prices scale with zps, maybe pps actually.
Revamp rush and other support units to be more in line with Starforce, boosting either Mega only or a variety, will likely depend.
Grapple seriously with the issue of art credit. We’re currently only using Time & Bond Man’s sprites illegally, but that will quite obviously change later down the line. 
Likewise, consider rebranding Starforce entirely. As of right now, it’s the last great holdover from the original, but it’s also very much a relic of that version, feeling a tad out of place. What then to replace it with? Some variant of Tank? Energy Elements?
